## About This Repository

This repository is my personal space to:

- **Learn** about various data structures and their applications.
- **Implement** data structures in Python with real-life examples.
- **Track** my progress over time.
- **Share** my journey with others.

By documenting my learning process, I aim to solidify my understanding and provide a resource for others to learn from. Each data structure is accompanied by a real-life project to demonstrate its practical use.
